<img src="Collaboration.jpg"
     alt="Repository Collaboration Image"

### My Single Line Code
To convert single line code to `embedded code` use single backticks.

### My Multiplt Line Code
Here's the example of Multiple line embedded code
```bash
#!/bin/bash

params=(
    show
    hello,
    world
    "multi word"
)
function show {
    echo --- Showing \""$@"\" as parameters ---
    for i in "$@"; do
        echo i=$i
    done
}
```

### My Sample json object
`json object` represented with `Markdown Language` will look like following:

```json
{ 
    "employee": {
        "Campus": [
            {"id":1,"name":"Robert Downey"},
            {"id":2,"name":"Elizabeth Olsen"}
        ],
        "country": {"id":2,"company":"MARVEL"}
    }, 
    "brewing": {
        "region": [
            {"id":1,"name":"Robert Downey"},
            {"id":2,"name":"Elizabeth Olsen"}
        ],
        "country": {"id":2,"company":"MARVEL"}
    }
}
```

### Table 
Let's learn how to create table using Markdown language:
