### Part A - Adding Files - Local Repo Workflow
We are using "git add" to push changes to staging area
the we use "git commit" to commit what we modified
and then "git push" to add those changes to Remote repo

With that we are saving the output of "git status" command in the files with their status

### Part B - Inspecting Local Repo with git status and git log
git status - show the current status of directory, in which state file is right now eg. Staging, Local or remote

git log - show the changes occured in past, it shows history like what changes have been done.
